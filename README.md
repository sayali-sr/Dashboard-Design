# Dashboard-Design
In this task, I created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize key insights from the coffee sales dataset. The dashboard highlights overall sales performance, number of orders, and quantity sold. I included charts like a pie chart to show the count of sales by product category, a bar chart to display total sales by product, and a line chart to show monthly sales trends. I also customized the dashboard’s background color and layout for a more polished look. There's still one chart space left, which I plan to use for adding “Profit by Product Category” to provide deeper insight into which items are most profitable.
